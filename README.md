# travel-agency-website

How I started the project:
1. Configure MAMP.
2. Configure PhpMyadmin.
3. In PhpMyadmin, create the user "c12ivan" with the password "Talan2020!@", create the "c12ivan" database (contents in the file c12ivan.sql).
4. Change the paths to pictures and pages (if necessary)

You can log in/register on the site. There is an admin panel through which you can add/delete tours, you can also see which users are registered.
You can comment and view blogs or tours.
