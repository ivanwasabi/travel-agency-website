My bachelor's project at the university

How I started the project:
1. Configure MAMP.
2. Configure PhpMyadmin.
3. In PhpMyadmin, create the user "c12ivan" with the password "Talan2020!@", create the "c12ivan" database (contents in the file c12ivan.sql).
4. Change the paths to pictures and pages (if necessary)

The site contains a registration form and a login. There is also an admin panel.
